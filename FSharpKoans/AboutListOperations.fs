Suggestion: before you do the next few files, read through and
understand this function:

let f xs =
   let rec innerF xs out =
      match xs with
      | [] -> out
      | _::rest -> innerF rest (1::out)
   innerF xs []

This is one of the idioms that you'll see (and use) again and again.

HINT: If you can't figure out what it does after reading through it and thinking about
it for a while, select it and push it down to the F# Interactive prompt using Alt+Enter.
Run it with some sample input, and see what it produces.

(*
A 'fold' starts from a specified state, and generates more states depending
on the elements of the list.  The last state that is generated is the one which
is returned.

Sounds complex?  Nah, it's not really ;).  Let's go through an example:
you have a list of numbers, and you want to find their sum.  Your list is
[9;4;2;7;5].  Obviously, the sum is 9+4+2+7+5 = 27.  But let's work it
out using a fold operation.

We'll start from the specified state 0.  Every time that we look at a number,
we'll add it to the state, thus generating the next state.  At the end, we'll
take the last-generated state.

State=0, Element=N/A, NextState=N/A   <- this is our initial state.  Then,
State=0, Element=9, NextState=0+9=9
State=9, Element=4, NextState=9+4=13
State=13, Element=2, NextState=13+2=15
State=15, Element=7, NextState=15+7=22
State=22, Element=5, NextState=22+5=27
... and then we run out of elements.

The very last state that was generated was 27.  So that's what we return.

When you get used to thinking in the 'pattern' of folding, you'll start to
see them everywhere.  Whenever you've got a list of things, and you're
reducing them to one value (whether summing, averaging, concatenating,
or something else), it's likely that you'll be able to use a fold.
