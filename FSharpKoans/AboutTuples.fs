(*
    A tuple is an ordered group of data.  A tuple is formed using the comma operator,
    NOT brackets.  In F#, brackets are used for precedence and ordering, not to form tuples.

    The number of elements in a tuple is called its *arity*.  We can call a tuple with 2
    items a 2-tuple, a tuple with 5 elements is a 5-tuple, and so on.
