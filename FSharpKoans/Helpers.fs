No, no.  This isn't the file you're looking for.
You should be starting on the next file, AboutTesting.fs.

This file contains the Black Magic that makes everything else work.
After you've finished the rest of the file, feel free to come

== Things That I Now Know About NUnit ==

NUnit's test adapter is horrible about name-mangling.
If a test ends with a bracket ), or a bracket ) and then whitespace,
it refuses to find the location of the test.  Why?  'cos NUnit.
So that's why we have method names ending with ")." instead.

And ordering tests is apparently far beyond its capabilities... :-/
